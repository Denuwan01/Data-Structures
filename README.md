Data Structures in Python
This repository contains various examples of data structures implemented in Python, demonstrating their practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Examples
1. Task Manager using a Singly Linked List
Description: A task manager application that uses a singly linked list to manage tasks. Each task has a description and a priority. Tasks are added to the list based on their priority, and the highest priority task can be completed first.

Key Features:

Add Task: Adds a task to the list in the correct position based on its priority.
Complete Task: Removes and displays the highest priority task from the list.
View Tasks: Displays all tasks in the list in order of their priority.
Usage: This example demonstrates how linked lists can be used to manage tasks efficiently, ensuring that higher priority tasks are always addressed first.

2. Playlist Manager using a Doubly Linked List
Description: A playlist manager application that uses a doubly linked list to manage a list of songs. Each song has a title and an artist. The application allows navigation forward and backward through the playlist.

Key Features:

Add Song: Adds a song to the end of the playlist.
Play Next Song: Plays the next song in the playlist.
Play Previous Song: Plays the previous song in the playlist.
Display Playlist: Displays all songs in the playlist.
Usage: This example illustrates the use of doubly linked lists to manage a playlist, allowing users to navigate through songs both forwards and backwards.

3. Browser History using a Stack
Description: A browser history management application that uses a stack to store the history of visited web pages. Each web page has a URL and a title. The application allows users to navigate back to previously visited pages.

Key Features:

Visit Page: Adds a new page to the history stack.
Back: Removes the most recent page from the history stack and returns to the previous page.
Current Page: Displays the current page in the history stack.
Usage: This example shows how stacks can be used to manage a web browser's history, providing an intuitive way to navigate back to previously visited pages.
